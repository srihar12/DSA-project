#include <stdio.h>

// Define a union named 'Data' that can hold an integer, float, and character
union Data {
    int integer;
    float floating;
    char character;
};

int main() {
    union Data data;

    // Accept input for an integer value
    printf("Enter an integer value: ");
    scanf("%d", &data.integer);

    // Accept input for a float value
    printf("Enter a float value: ");
    scanf("%f", &data.floating);

    // Accept input for a character value
    printf("Enter a character value: ");
    scanf(" %c", &data.character);

    // Display the values stored in the union
    printf("\nValues stored in the union:\n");
    printf("Integer value: %d\n", data.integer);
    printf("Float value: %f\n", data.floating);
    printf("Character value: %c\n", data.character);

    return 0;
}



Result:
This program demonstrates the use of a union by accepting input values for an integer, a float, and a character, storing them in the union, and displaying them. Since a union can only hold one value at a time, storing a new value will overwrite the previous value

Union For Representing Different Shapes (circle, square, rectangle)
Develop a program that defines a union for representing different shapes (circle, square, rectangle) with appropriate fields for each. Implement functions to:
Calculate and display the area of each shape. Determine and print the largest area among the shapes.
Input Format
Enter the number of shapes: 3 Enter type of shape (0 for circle, 1
for square, 2 for rectangle) for shape 1: 0
Enter radius of circle: 33
Enter type of shape (0 for circle, 1 for square, 2 for rectangle) for shape 2: 2
Enter length and width of rectangle: 45 67
Enter type of shape (0 for circle, 1 for square, 2 for rectangle) for shape 3: 1
Enter side length of square: 23
Output Format
Areas of shapes:
Area of circle 1: 3421.19
Area of square 2: 2025.00
Area of rectangle 3: 0.00
Largest area among the shapes: 3421.19

Aim:

To develop a program that defines a union for representing different shapes (circle, square, rectangle) and implements functions to calculate and display the area of each shape, as well as determine and print the largest area among the shapes:

Algorithm:
1.	Start
2.	Define a union named Shape with appropriate fields for representing different shapes:
•	For a circle, include a field for radius.
•	For a square, include a field for side length.
•	For a rectangle, include fields for length and width.
3.	Define a structure named Circle with a field for the radius.
4.	Define a structure named Square with a field for the side length.
5.	Define a structure named Rectangle with fields for the length and width.
6.	Define a function calculateArea that takes a union Shape as input and returns the calculated area based on the type of shape (circle, square, or rectangle).
7.	Define a function displayAreas that takes an array of unions shapes and its size as input, calculates and displays the area of each shape.
8.	Define a function findLargestArea that takes an array of unions shapes and its size as input, determines the largest area among the shapes, and returns it.
9.	In the main function: a.  the user to enter the number of shapes. b. Dynamically allocate memory to store the shapes. c. Read details for each shape: - For a circle, prompt the user to enter the radius. - For a square, prompt the user to enter the side length. - For a rectangle, prompt the user to enter the length and width. d. Calculate and display the area of each shape using the displayAreas function. e. Determine and print the largest area among the shapes using the findLargestArea function. f. Free dynamically allocated memory.
10.	End.
